                        <p>As a 3rd year Actuarial Science student, I have seen and experienced the pros and cons of pursuing an actuary degree. Pursuing this degree gives me a broad perspective over different fields such as computing, economics, social studies and mathematics. I am able to create my own destiny as the knowledge learned over the year can aid in my job selection. With my fellow classmates, I was never bored. While learning and studying, my friends and other acquaintances ensured that we also enjoy our university life and gain experiences like doing outreachs, voluntary work and having meetings with other actuarial students.
                            <br>Even though sometimes the work gets hard sometimes, I still give my all in all of my assignments and exams as it's my dream to be a well-known actuary. I wouldn't recommend this field for everyone but if you have a love for math and economics, I say go for it.

                        <p>Computer science is one of the world's largest fields and the knowledge and skills we can gain from a computing course are applicable and in great demand across the globe. Some specializations are Software Development, Data Management, Web Development, Computer Engineering and many more. Computing is everywhere in our lives today and as moe years come to pass and more techologies are introduced, hence more job opportunites will arise.
                            <br>As you continue to specialize in this work field, you build character and network with other persons studying in the same field as you. Personnaly, the reason why I have a liking to Computer Science is becuase of its connection to Mathematics as well as I tend to enjoy learning about coding as well as working with computers.
